# Overview

The API Agent project is a Python-based solution that enhances the capabilities of an AI system by integrating external data sources through API communication and web scraping. The project includes a user-friendly UI design, making it accessible to a broader audience.

This system enables the AI to answer user queries by fetching real-time data from external APIs or websites. For example, when asked, "What's the weather today in Paris?", the AI leverages the API Agent to gather the required data and provides an accurate response.
